The data set I will be using can be found here.\nThis project would not have been possible without the knowledge gained from Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp."

    "text": "Project Summary\nNBA FT% (Free Throw Percentage) varies based on which player plays what position. The following data that was analyzed came from the FantasyPros website. From the retrieved data, I filtered the data such that I was looking at players’ free throw percentage for those who played more than 20 minutes to make a better prediction of players that will get valuable minutes next season. I predicted FT%s for each position using the Bayesian Posterior Prediction Model and determined the median of the data set was the predicted percentage. The predicted FT% for the 2023-24 NBA season for a PG is 76%, 81% for an SG, 78% for an SF, 75.5% for a PF, and 71% for a C."
