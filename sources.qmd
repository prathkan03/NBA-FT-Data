When I had first gotten the data, I first selected the free throw attempted and free throws made columns. Next, I had to clean the data to eliminate outliers, which were players that did not attempt enough free throws. Next, I created a predicted estimated to create a fitted object and then used a histogram to visually represent the prediction. I have also displayed the median vertical line on the histogram.
