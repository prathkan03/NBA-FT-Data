## About Me
My name is [Pratham Kancherla](https://github.com/prathkan03) and I am a sophomore at The Ohio State University. My major is Computer Science & Engineering and I am proficient in Python, Java, R, HTML.

## About My Project
This project will focus on analyzing each of the 5 positions in basketball, the PG (Point Guard), SG (Shooting Guard), SF (Small Forward), PF (Power Forward), C (Center), and finding the position with the best average FT%. The data set I will be using can be found [here](https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/stats/avg-overall.php). 

This project would not have been possible without the knowledge gained from [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info).
